						<h2> Our Mission</h2>
							<p>Our Mission is to continue to be a thriving part of the Hamilton community. Allowing people from all walks of life to enjoy our sport.<p>

									<h4> Our History</h4>
													<p>Formed over 50 years ago in the old town of Hamilton. Self sufficient from the start, it automatically became a sport focal point of the community. One of the principle features was its ability to have its own premises which allowed the development of top Scottish, British and European champions. These players were able to train every evening at little cost which was the enabler for there progression in the sport.
													</p>
													<p>

													Moving from the old town to Hill House in the 90’s has expanded the club’s catchment area. The junior classes can have 40 kids on the mat at one time. The Senior class up to 15 black belts on certain nights. Hamilton always have visiting Judo players from around the world at the sessions to try their own abilities in our legendary Randori sessions. 
													<p>
														<p>The fundamentals have never changed in which all players are encouraged to develop their own coaching skills and pass on the Hamilton ethos, to the next generation. Hamilton were particular successful during the 70's, 80's and 90's. With a brand of Judo which was synonymous with high energy, complex hip techniques and the ability to transitions between the standing and ground work disciplines at speed, without a change in quality.
														<p>
															<p> The pillars of the clubs success are routed in the training belief that with uchi-komi and high intense Randori sessions. Each individual player will develop into a rounded competitor due to the focused training.
