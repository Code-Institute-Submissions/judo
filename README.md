#Hamilton Judo Club Project 

(https://kanepa.github.io/judo)



#### The idea behind this website was to enchance the older Judo club website 
#### from a fact based site to a more interactive video site.  
#### A site were the club members could go to the site to see the most recent 
#### coaching sessions. This will open up the club to be able to communcate to 
#### their members in a more up todate method.
#### The club members to be able to use the site to study for their 
#### grading exams by selecting the grade. Then for the site to 
#### show them what throws they had to learn in the way of a YouTube video. 


## Technoloy used

* HTML
* CSS/Bootstrap
* JQuery
* javascript

##  Tech Challenges

#### Planning and sourcing the correct code that would enable the user to pick 
#### from a selection of throws and for the correct video to appear on the 
#### screen. This meant breaking down the event into stages and working through
#### each section on its own.
#### Understanding that I had to us the javascript array with the split
#### symbol to move the each throw through each stage 
#### Then using the else if statement to match up the throw with the correct 
#### video on the Youtube link. 


### Bootstrap/Mobile Nav

#### On mobile display the Nav Bar once pressed, stayed down and was getting
#### in the way of the content of the screen. So I had to use a JQuery function
#### when the nav bar was on toggle then bar releases back up.

#### With the Bootstrap Carousel the original images were all different sizes 
#### which lead to a flicker on the screen. I had to use image editors to make
#### sure the image sizes were all the same which resolved the problem
